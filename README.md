# Network-Scanner
Network Scanner Tool is a Python-based utility for performing basic network reconnaissance. This tool helps identify devices connected to a network, scan for open ports, and discover active services.

How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-scanner.git
cd network-scanner
Install required dependencies (if any):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
(This tool uses only built-in Python libraries, so no external dependencies are required.)

Run the script:

bash
python network_scanner.py
Select an option:

Option 1: Enter a network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) to discover devices.
Option 2: Enter an IP address to scan for open ports.
Example commands:

Discover devices:
bash
Enter network range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24): 192.168.1.0/24
Scan ports:
bash
Enter the IP address to scan: 192.168.1.10
